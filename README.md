# Py_n_Ne 
AA 2018/2019) Python and Network class @IMT Lucca

The course intend to provide an introduction to programming in python. The application are going to be application to the analysis of complex networks.

## Structure of the course (more for Fabio than for others...)
Lesson -1) Installation and why
   - Conda and virtual environments
   - Github
   - Jupyter Notebooks

Lesson 0) Basics:
   - Data type
   - Basic functions
   - Logical functions
   - List, tuple
   - Loops
   
Lesson 1) Still basics
   - Dictionaries
   - Function 
   - Files
   
Lesson 2) Numpy:
   - numpy arrays and functions of numpy arrays
   - numpy arrays with structured data
   - load files/save files
   - obtain the adjacency matrix
   - calculate the degree sequence
   - calculate the clustering coefficient
   - save everything somewhere
   
Lesson 2.0.1) Numpy Random and Random Graphs
   - basic random submodule function for the definition of a Random Graph/Configuration Model as benchmarks
   
Lesson 2.1) Pandas
   - extra
   
Lesson 3) Matplotlib 
   - Structure of a matplotlib plot
   - plots, scatters, histograms
   - legend

Lesson 4) request and BeautifulSoup: how to get the data

   - examining the structure of a webpage
   - handling the exceptions

### Numpy, Scipy, Pandas
[Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/ "The best module ever")  
We did not used it, but [Scipy](https://scipy.org/) is part of the family of Numpy and Pandas and has submodules of statistics, equation solvers among many others...
[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html#)

### Matplotlib

### Some tricks
The [Remote Notebook](https://coderwall.com/p/ohk6cg/remote-access-to-ipython-notebooks-via-ssh) guide teaches how to use a jupyter notebook remotely from a server.
[tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) is a cool way to have a progress bar in your loops
[Jupyter Widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20Basics.html) are cool, but sometimes it's more annoying fixing them than the beauty they add to your notebook.
