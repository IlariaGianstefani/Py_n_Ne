# Py_n_Ne 
AA 2018/2019) Python and Network class @IMT Lucca

The course intend to provide an introduction to programming in python. The application are going to be application to the analysis of complex networks.

## Structure of the course (more for Fabio than for others...)
Lesson 0.5) Where are we?
   - what is Python
   - Conda and virtual environments
   - Github

Lesson 1.) Basics:
   - List
   - Dictionaries
   - Strings 
   - Loops
   
Lesson 2.) Numpy:
   - load an edgelist
   - obtain the adjacency matrix
   - calculate the degree sequence
   - calculate the clustering coefficient
   - calculate the diameter of the network (or something equally odd)
   - save everything somewhere
   - Extra:
           * vector with structured data
           * pandas (pandas exist; representation of data; search; play with rows and columns)
           
Lesson 3.) Axis: matplotlib 
   - Structure of a matplotlib plot
   - multigraph
   - colors
   - legend
   - jupyter widgets

Lesson 4.) Networkx: You've got a Friend in me

   - something to calculate
   - something to plot
    (the Chessa notebook can be re-used)
   - write a Louvain community detection
   - Extra: python-igraph, the package of the beast (community detection)
   
Lesson 5.) Harvest: request and BeautifulSoup

   - examining the structure of a webpage
   - handling the exceptions
   - how to get the data we worked on
